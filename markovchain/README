Order-2 Markov chain program
by Andrew M. Launder

This program uses an order-2 Markov chain algorithm to produce a
semi-intelligible gibberish story given a sizable input of text.

Once you've compiled the program, enter the following into the command line:

    path/to/executable/markovchain [wordcount (optional; default = 100)] [inputfile]
    
    [wordcount]: the number of words you wish to print.
                 Must be greater than 0 and less than 10000.
    
    [inputfile]: the name of your input file. To ensure best results, 
                 make sure that your input file contains no empty lines.
