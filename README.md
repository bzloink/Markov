When I started my postdoc, I wrote these two codes to practice C++.

The directory <code>markovchain</code> contains an order-2 Markov chain algorithm to produce blocks of pseudotext given a sizable input. I tested it using <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen.

The directory <code>markovcluster</code> contains the Markov clustering algorithm, sample input matrix, and expected output.
