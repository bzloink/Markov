Markov clustering algorithm
by Andrew M. Launder
    
This program takes a given transition matrix and runs the Markov clustering
algorithm to cluster the data.

Once you've compuled the program, enter the following into the command line:
    
    path/to/executable/markovcluster [inputfile]
    
    [inputfile]: the name of your input file. To ensure best results,
                 make sure that your input file contains a transition matrix
                 of at least 2 x 2 size with the following format:
    
                 x[1][1] x[1][2] . . . x[1][n]
                 x[2][1] x[2][2] . . . x[2][n]
                    .       .    .        .   
                    .       .      .      .   
                    .       .        .    .   
                 x[n][1] x[n][2] . . . x[n][n]

                 (where x[i][j] is the numerical value of the (i, j) element
                  of the matrix, and n is the order).

If you would like to use values other than the defaults,
enter the following into the command line:
    
    path/to/executable/markovcluster [convexp] [maxiter] [inflation] [zeroconvexp] [inputfile]
    
    [convexp]: the convergence criterion for the RMS of the transition matrix elements,
               defined as 10^-x, where x is convexp. Default value is 6.
    
    [maxiter]: the maximum number of iterations. Default value is 100.
    
    [inflation]: the power used in the inflation step. Default value is 2.
    
    [zeroconvexp]: the threshold for setting a given matrix element to 0,
                   defined as 10^-x, where x is zeroconvexp. Default value is 15.
    
    [inputfile]: as described above.
